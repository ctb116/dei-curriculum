## Overview of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reflections
---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum at Epicodus includes periodic workshops, a discussion on microaggressions, written lessons integrated throughout each learning track, and reflective assignments for each written lesson. We call these reflective assignments "personal reflections", where you'll write a short response to a prompt on the topic of the corresponding DEI lesson. 

Before you start writing your reflection, please carefully review the lesson on [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reflective Assignments](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/dei-curriculum-overview/dei-reflective-assignments) to understand the expectations for these assignments.

We hope you find these reflective assignments to be thought-provoking! We always welcome feedback on your experience of the DEI curriculum, including these reflective assignments. We outline all of the ways you can give feedback in [the student handbook](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#giving-feedback). 

## Today's Reflection

### Social Identities

Please write a reflection about this prompt:

> Think about your social identities. Which ones fit the stereotype of a "typical" tech worker and which ones don't? At Epicodus, which of your identities are shared by a majority of other students, and which ones aren't? If you do not want to disclose your social identities, share about how learning and thinking about social identities changes how you approach pair programming in class.
