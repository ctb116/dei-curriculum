## Overview of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reflections
---

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) curriculum at Epicodus includes periodic workshops, a discussion on microaggressions, written lessons integrated throughout each learning track, and reflective assignments for each written lesson. We call these reflective assignments "personal reflections", where you'll write a short response to a prompt on the topic of the corresponding DEI lesson. 

Before you start writing your reflection, please carefully review the lesson on [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reflective Assignments](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/dei-curriculum-overview/dei-reflective-assignments) to understand the expectations for these assignments.

We hope you find these reflective assignments to be thought-provoking! We always welcome feedback on your experience of the DEI curriculum, including these reflective assignments. We outline all of the ways you can give feedback in [the student handbook](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus/student-handbook#giving-feedback).  

## Today's Reflection

### Jokes and Appropriate Humor

Please write a reflection about this prompt:

> Jokes can often walk on a fine line between offensive and humorous. What is your take on this fine line? Do you think that punching upwards versus downwards is a helpful distinction?
